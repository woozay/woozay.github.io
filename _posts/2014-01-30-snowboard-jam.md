**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!

This is our first Android application, it was first coded in Adobe Flash CS5, a free and paid version were uploaded to the Android Market. The free version had received over 1,000 downloads and the paid version over 10. Since its success, I re-coded the application in Java and re-uploaded it. The free version has now received over 10,000 downloads.
