## HOYG
HOYG is a website that shows you the retailers selling PS4 and Xbox One games for the cheapest price, in the UK. It is written in Spring Boot with a separate backend and frontend. Check the website out [here](http://www.hoyg.co.uk). The [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hoyguk) page automatically tweets the games which have a new lowest price.
