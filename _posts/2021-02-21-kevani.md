## Kevani
Kevani is the second game by Woozay. The game is available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nab.game). It is a top down pixel art stealth game. Your mission is to go floor by floor silently eliminating all enemies. A trailer for the game is on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGRYLTnQ3IM).

The game took around 5 months to make. The game is build using [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), collision detection is done by [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) and AI using [gdxAI](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai). A partial dev log is also available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihkZfhrSylw&list=PLUYYbTpxFSeiFzMMoNFSEmwY4hwIzupPA). The pixel art was done by us then refined by [Camila Xiao](https://camilaxiao.wordpress.com/).
